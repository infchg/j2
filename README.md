#  ðŸŒŒ Interest: Thinking about fundamental questions

Quantum Information for practical usages, as well as theoretical tools for exploring Nature 

# Profile: Past, Planned
- Past steps: Theoretical [Physics-Based-Information-Models](#-Physics-Based-Information-Models) published with QKD examples. 
- Recent research on [QI-Tools-Applications](#-QI-Tools--Applications) with Hilbert space and Bloch sphere 
- Next proposal: inter-disciplinary collaboration [planned 2022-23](#planned-2022-23) nearby NYC, part-time:
   - bring two decades achieving complex IT with Teams, Hardware, Instruments, Linux, Routes, DevOps, Python, Cloud 
   - & works with QI theory, matrix operators, eigenstates... plus experiment notions from papers and QisKit 

# Planned 2022-23

*Part-time* due to current commitment delivering a technology project full-time:

- 2022 submitting new journal paper on Bloch & QI framework + another measured from real QC circuits 
- 2023 Q1Q2 collaborations nearby NY towards cloud quantum computing

#  ðŸŒ± Physics-Based Information Models 

Proposed Physics-Based Models (alike Toffoli, Benioff, Kirchhoff) and Feynman-charts of Information Change.

## ðŸ“• Reference on new methods of investigation, and new collaborations 

Principles & Productivity Ideas

### Notebooks for sharing codes and results

Example of codes & results using  Azure, QisKit, and IonQC ![](AzQisKitIon.JPG) 

### Delivering by Agile & Modern https://modernagile.org/

Fostering Models & Methods in collaborations:

Historic agile XP boosted interdisciplinary teams since 2001, from teams analyzing data to developers to hardware engineers accessing states at tiny fractions of a second. ModernAgile has four pillars: 

- People collaborations enhanced (Git & Jupyter Notebooks);
- Repeat and Continuously Improve (automated pipelines); 
- allowing rapid experimentation;
-  Safe by working in pairs, consumer/provider. It avoided hw/coders overwhelmed or analysts/theorist disappointed.

```

### Simple Generic frameworks helped build and repeat easily, boosting innovation 

   In the 70s, the DoD's Internet Protocol grew communications exponentially. In the 90â€™s the CERN's Web open radically boosted information exchange. In 201x's Quantum Computers seamless access helped hundreds of thousands researchers. 

### Effective 5 steps Innovation

Applied recurrently this method inspired in Agile Six Sigma:

- Listen & innovate designs, 
- measure, 
- analyze, 
- continuously automate, 
- communicate & control.
