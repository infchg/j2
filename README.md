#  ðŸŒŒ Interest: Thinking about fundamental questions

Quantum Information for practical usages, as well as theoretical tools for exploring Nature 

# Profile: Past, Planned
 

#  ðŸŒ± Physics-Based Information Models 

Proposed Physics-Based Models (alike Toffoli, Benioff, Kirchhoff) and Feynman-charts of Information Change.
 
#  ðŸŒ± QI Tools & Applications 

Exploring common frameworks to represent light modes coding qubits across diverse experiments
 
#  â™¥ Thanks to past teams and collaborators.

With gratitude to teams who accepted posters contributions during PhD studies and helped evolve these ideas from early stages:

## ðŸ“• Reference, new methods of investigation, and new collaborations 

Principles & Productivity Ideas

### Leveraging JuPyter Notebooks for sharing QI codes and results

### Delivering by Agile & Modern https://modernagile.org/

Fostering Models & Methods in collaborations:

Historic agile XP boosted interdisciplinary teams since 2001, from teams analyzing data to developers to hardware engineers accessing states at tiny fractions of a second. ModernAgile has four pillars: 

- People collaborations enhanced (Git & Jupyter Notebooks);
- Repeat and Continuously Improve (automated pipelines); 
- allowing rapid experimentation;
-  Safe by working in pairs, consumer/provider. It avoided hw/coders overwhelmed or analysts/theorist disappointed.

### Simple Generic frameworks helped build and repeat easily, boosting innovation 

   In the 70s, the DoD's Internet Protocol grew communications exponentially. In the 90â€™s the CERN's Web open radically boosted information exchange. In 201x's Quantum Computers seamless access helped hundreds of thousands researchers. 

### Effective 5 steps Innovation

Applied recurrently this method inspired in Agile Six Sigma:

- Listen & innovate designs, 
- measure, 
- analyze, 
- continuously automate, 
- communicate & control.
